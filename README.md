# PetsHome
Testing site using requests and selenium lib.
upd1: Add header links check
upd2: Add checks social icon link, get values from sort page fields, get values from API sort (Species, Breed, Gender, Status).
There are all ready BUGs in output print. Some values are not unique, some repeated, in API values much more the in the Page Sort fields. 
Have to compare.
